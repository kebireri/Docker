This folder contains my personal hands-on work for learning Docker and containerization concepts.
It includes small practice projects, experiments, and exercises used to build confidence with:

- writing Dockerfiles

- building and tagging images

- running containers locally

- working with container networking

- using Docker Compose

- connecting apps to databases inside containers

- troubleshooting builds and runtime behavior

The purpose of this space is exploration and learning (not polished production apps).
Each subfolder or project represents part of my journey gaining practical containerization skills.
